/**
 * **Where this copy of isocan is, asked once and answered the same way from
 * every copy** (`docs/projects/first-minute/design.md`, change 1).
 *
 * Six files used to count directories up from their own source — `myRoot()` in
 * the CLI, `root` in the server's build stamp, the web app's `dist`, the
 * daemon bin the API spawns — and every one of them was right only because
 * the file it was written in never moved. The release CLI is now one bundled
 * file at `packages/cli/dist/isocan.mjs`, so `import.meta.url` inside it is
 * the bundle's, not the source's, and `../../..` means something different
 * for every module that was folded into it. Counting directories cannot
 * survive that; asking the filesystem can.
 *
 * So: walk up from wherever the caller is until a `package.json` says its name
 * is `isocan`. That is true in a checkout, in the bundle, in `npm i -g`'s
 * tree, and under `~/.isocan/current/node_modules/isocan` — four layouts, one
 * answer, and no file has to know how deep it sits.
 *
 * **Not exported from `@isocan/core`'s index**, and the subpath is the reason:
 * the index is bundled for browsers (`scripts/release.mjs`,
 * RELEASE_BROWSER_BUNDLES) where a `node:fs` import anywhere in the closure
 * fails the build. Reach it as `@isocan/core/packageroot`.
